This project aims to build an image classification model that can classify satellite images by 3 components: atmospheric conditions, common land cover/land use phenomena, and rare land cover/land use phenomena. As an example, there could be a partially-cloudy visual of lush trees/river with a legal mining process in one image. Another image could be classified as just ‘cloudy’. Before implementing various ML models we plan to perform image processing like DCP (Dark Channel Prior) for the ‘hazy’ images and data augmentation for better performance.
